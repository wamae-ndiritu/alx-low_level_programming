# C - Variadic Functions

### Project Tasks
[0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant](./0-sum_them_all.c)
> Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
- Protoytpe: `int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);`
- If `n == 0`, return `0`.

[1. To be is to be the value of a variable](./1-print_numbers.c)
> Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);`
- where `separator` is the string to be printed between numbers
- and `n` is the number of integers passed to the function
- You are allowed to use `printf`
- If `separator` is `NULL`, don't print it
- Print a new line at the end of your function
