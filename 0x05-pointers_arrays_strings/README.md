# Pointers, Arrays & Strings

[0. 98 Battery st.](./0-reset_to_98.c) - Creating a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98. This is called `dereferncing` where we can manipulate the value of that the pointer points to.

[1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream](./1-swap.c) - Creating a function that swaps the values of two integers. The values of the intergers are referenced by the pointers passed as the argument of the function. To swap them, we need to copy the value of one to another integer, then swap them, and finally update the last one to the copied value.
