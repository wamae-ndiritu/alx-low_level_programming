# Variables & Conditionals

[0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](./0-positive_or_negative.c) - In this task, our aim is to check whether a integer is either positive or negative. To do so we will use the `if else` condition to check whethet a random generated integer is greater than 0 thus positive, if less than zero, it is negative and otherwise it is equal to zero. The integer is saved to a variable and then used.

[1. The last digit](./1-last_digit.c) - Here we are generating a random integer and getting its last digit. To get the last digit, we can perform an arithmetic operation using modulus, `%` operator. This operation gives the remainders when you divide 2 numbers. In our case to get the last number, will take `n%10` and this will give us the digit. We can then apply some conditions to this digit using `if..else`. Remember the result for the modulus operation is stored to a variale and then used in the conditions.
