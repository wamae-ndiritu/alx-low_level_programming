# Recursion

[0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget](./0-puts_recursion.c) - Creating a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. The function should be similar to `puts()` function. Since, we are learning **recursion**, we can use `putchar()` like function which only prints one character at a time. However, instead of looping through the loop to print all the characters of the string, we call the function recursively to print all the charcters of the string. Our **base case** will be where the `*s == '\0'`, meaning we have reached the end of the string.

[1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together](./1-print_rev_recursion.c) - Creating a function that prints a string in reverse order, using `_putchar()` and recursion. This time, we will not print the characters before calling the function recursively, instead, we will call the function recursively and then print the values printed by each recursion starting with the most latest one, which happens to be the last character. The last character of the string will therefpore be printed the first, and hence we have a reversed string.

[2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange](./2-strlen_recursion.c) - Creating a function that returns the length of a string. The function is similar to the `strlen()` function. For any string passed, we can check whether the character using **pointer arithmetic** is equal the terminating character, and if so we return a 0. However, if thats not the case, the function will return the count which is always set to `1` as every character accessed using the pointer arithmetic has a length of 1. Then the function will call itself recursively, adding 1 every time until the pointer s will point to the null character signifying the end of the string. This is our `base case` of the function, where the function stops calling itself. The function will add all the values return at each call and return it as the length of the string.

[3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling](./3-factorial.c) - Creating a function that returns the factorial of a given number. If the number passed is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error, and the factorial of 0 is 1. This can be done by calling the function recursively, with the `base case` as the factorial of 0, then we can return the number, and call the again but with `n - 1` until `n`-1 == 0` whose factorial is 0. Here the function stop calling itself and adds all the return values of each function call and returns them as the fctorial of the number that was passed.
