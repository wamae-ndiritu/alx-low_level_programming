# Even More Pointers, Arrays & Strings

[0. memset](./0-memset.c) - In this task, we are to create a function that fills the first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `b`. The function makes use of the `memset()` function in C Library that fills a certain bytes of the memory area pointed to by the pointer passed as an argument with a certain constant.

[1. memcpy](./1-memcpy.c) - Creating a function that copies `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`. The function uses the `memcpy()` function in C Library that copies a specified number of bytes from a memory area pointed to by a pointer and copies to a memory area pointed by anothe pointer. This function returns a pointer to memory area where the bytes have been copied to.
