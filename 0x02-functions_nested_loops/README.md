# Functions & Nested loops

[0. _putchar](./0-putchar.c) - A simple program to print the string `_putchar`.

[1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](./1-alphabet.c) - In this task, we are using a custom function called `_putchar` to print alphabets in lowercase. The task shows us how to create custom header files that references your custom functions that can be used in different source files. Function protoype such as `void print_alphabet(void);` is defined in the header files and included with `#include "main.h"` in the implementation file assuming the prototypes has been defined in a header file called `main.h`.
