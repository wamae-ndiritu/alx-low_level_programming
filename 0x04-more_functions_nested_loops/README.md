# More Functions & Nested loops

[0. isupper](./0-isupper.c) - A program to checker whether the character passed as the argument of the function if an uppercase or not. We make use of the `isupper()` function in the standard Library and defined in the `ctype.h` header file.

[1. isdigit](./1-isdigit.c) - This task aims at checking for digits (0 through 9). It uses the `isdigit()` function in the standard Library defined in the `ctype.h` header file.

[2. Collaboration is multiplication](./2-mul.c) - A function that takes two integers and return their product. The custom function is called `mul()` and has been defined in the `main.h` found on the project.

[3. The numbers speak for themselves](./3-print_numbers.c) - A program to print all the numbers from 0 to 9. We make use of a `for` loop and to print the number we use `_putchar()` that has been defined in the custom header file `main.h`.

[4. I believe in numbers and signs](./4-print_most_numbers.c) - A program that uses the `_putchar()` as above to print all digits from 0 to 9 except 2 and 4. To do this, we can use the logical and `&&` while giving our conditions such that `i != 2 && i != 4 `, i is not equal to 2 and not equal to 4.
